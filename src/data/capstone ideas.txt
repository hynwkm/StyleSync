kind of like doordash, but for fashion. you hire a person with a similar height and build, you then hire them to buy clothing items (2shirt, 1 jacket, 1 shoe) with budgets($50, $100, $75) and you are then delivered them to you. you can easily make a return if you don't like them. you can see and rate the person you are hiring. there might be a comission fee?
